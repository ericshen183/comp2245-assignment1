 <h2>Name: Eric Shen</h2>
 <p>About myself <br>I am a level 2 student at the UWI Five islands campus, currently
studying Computer Science. I am from Antigua and Barbuda and I am
interested in web development and software engineering. My other interests include Artificial intelligence and Game development. My hobbies include drawing, reading and playing video games.
During my free time I also cook, studying new recipes. Web development to me is a very interesting field to place an interest in due to the various possibilities that it brings with it. 
It is a field with high demand given the current pace the world is headed in, a world of technology. Web development is also high earning job and is the main reason for my interest in this field.</p>
